Art.37
To the extent that the GDPR requires the appointment of a DPO (see Chapter 12), that requirement applies to processors.

Rec.97; Art.37
A controller or processor must appoint a DPO if local laws require it to do so, or if its data processing activities involve:regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or processing Sensitive Personal Data on a large scale.A corporate group may collectively appoint a single DPO. Organisations that are not required to appoint a DPO are free to do so voluntarily. If a DPO is appointed, the organisation must publish the details of the DPO, and communicate those details to the relevant DPA.
<br><br>
Rec.97; Art.37(5)-(6)
A DPO should have expert knowledge of data protection law and practice, and should be capable of performing the functions of a DPO (outlined below). A DPO can be an employee or an outside consultant.
<br><br>
Art.38(1)-(2), (4)-(5)
The DPO must deal with all data protection matters affecting the controller or processor properly and in a timely manner. The controller or processor must provide the DPO with the necessary resources and support. Data subjects may contact the DPO (e.g., to exercise their rights under the GDPR). The DPO must be bound by a confidentiality obligation in relation to his or her work.
<br><br>
Art.38(3)
The organisation cannot instruct the DPO in the performance of his or her duties, and cannot terminate the DPOs employment (or take any other disciplinary action) as a result of the performance of the DPOs duties.
<br><br>
Art.38(6), 39
A DPO must fulfil at least the following tasks:
informing and advising the relevant controller or processor (and any employees who process personal data) about their obligations under the GDPR; monitor compliance with the GDPR by the controller or processor; advise on Impact Assessments and prior consultation with DPAs; and cooperate with DPAs and act as a point

<br><br>
Art.28(2), (4)
The processor must not appoint a sub-processor without the prior written consent of the controller. Where the controller agrees to the appointment of sub-processors, those sub‑processors must be appointed on the same terms as are set out in the contract between the controller and the processor, and in any case in accordance with Art.28(1)‑(2) (see above).

Rec.79; Art.4(7), 26
Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, they are joint controllers. Joint controllers must, by means of an arrangement between them, apportion data protection compliance responsibilities between themselves (e.g., the responsibility for providing clear information to data subjects – see Chapter 9). A summary of the arrangement must be made available for the data subject. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data subjects.

Each joint controller is liable for the entirety of the damage, although national law may apportion liability between them. A controller may be exempted from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. If one joint controller has paid full compensation, it may then bring proceedings against the other joint controllers to recover their portions of the damages.
