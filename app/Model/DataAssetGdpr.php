Art.4(1)
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person. 
<br><br>
Rec.10, 34, 35, 51; Art.9(1)
Sensitive Personal Data are personal data, revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership; data concerning health or sex life and sexual orientation; genetic data or biometric data. Data relating to criminal offences and convictions are addressed separately (as criminal law lies outside the EUs legislative competence).
<br><br>
Rec. 19, 50, 73, 80, 91, 97; Art.10
Data relating to criminal offences and convictions may only be processed by national authorities. National law may provide derogations, subject to suitable safeguards. A comprehensive register of criminal offences may only be kept by the responsible national authority.
<br><br>
Rec.26, 28-29, 75, 78, 156; Art.4(5), 6(4)(e), 25(1), 32(1)(a), 40(2)(d), 89(1)
Pseudonymous data are still treated as personal data because they enable the identification of individuals (albeit via a key). However, provided that the key that enables reâ€‘identification of individuals is kept separate and secure, the risks associated with pseudonymous data are likely to be lower, and so the levels of protection required for those data are likely to be lower.
<br><br>
Rec. 35, 53-54; Art.4(15)
Data concerning health means personal data relating to the physical or mental health of an individual, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status. It expressly covers both physical and mental health.
<br><br>
Art.10, 23(1)(j)
Personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures may only be processed: under the control of an official authority; or when permitted under EU or Member State law.Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions may be kept only under the control of official authority.
Member States may impose restrictions on the processing of personal data for the purposes of enforcing civil law claims.
<br><br>
Rec.51-56; Art.9
The processing of Sensitive Personal Data is prohibited, unless:
<br>Art.9(2)(a) The data subject has given explicit consent.
<br>Art.9(2)(b) The processing is necessary in the context of employment law, or laws relating to social security and social protection.
<br>Art.9(2)(c) The processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject (or another person) here the data subject is ncapable of giving consent.
<br>Art.9(2)(d) The processing s carried out in the course of the legitimate activities of a charity or not-for-profit body, with respect to its own members, former members, or persons with whom it has regular contact in connection with its purposes.
<br>Art.9(2)(e) The processing relates to personal data which have been manifestly made public by the data subject.
<br>Art.9(2)(f) The processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or for courts acting in their judicial capacity.
<br>Art.9(2)(g) The processing is necessary for reasons of substantial publicinterest, and occurs on the basis of a law that is, inter alia, proportionate to the aim pursued and protects the rights of data subjects.
<br>Art.9(2)(h), (3) The processing is required for the purpose of medical treatment undertaken by health professionals, including assessing the working capacity of employees and the management of health or social care systems and services.
<br>Art.9(2)(i) The processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health (e.g., ensuring the safety of medicinal products).
<br>Art.9(2)(j) The processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, for historical, scientific, research or statistical purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards.
<br>Art.9(4) Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations with regard to genetic data, biometric data or health data.

Rec.57; Art.11, 12(2)
To the extent that the controller can demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller is exempt from the application of the rights of data subjects in Art.15â€‘22. The controller is also not obliged to obtain further personal data in order to link data in its possession to a data subject.

Rec.59; Art.12(3)-(4)
A controller must, within one month of receiving a request made under those rights, provide any requested information in relation to any of the rights of data subjects. If the controller fails to meet this deadline, the data subject may complain to the relevant DPA and may seek a judicial remedy. Where a controller receives large numbers of requests, or especially complex requests, the time limit may be extended by a maximum of two further months.

Rec.40; Art.6(1)
In order for the processing of personal data to be lawful, the controller requires either the consent of the data subject or another lawful basis.
<br><br>Rec.32; Art.4(11), 6(1)(a), 7
Consent means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subjects agreement to the processing of his or her personal data. Consent must be given by a statement or a clear affirmative action.
<br><br>Rec.32, 43; Art.7(4)
Consent will not be valid if the data subject has no genuine and free choice, or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.
Where there is a clear imbalance between the controller and the data subject (e.g., between an employer and an employee), consent is presumed not to have been free
ly given. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account must be taken of whether the performance of a contract is made conditional on the data subject consenting to processing activities that are not necessary for the performance of that contract.
<br><br>
Rec.32; Art.6(1)(a)
Consent must be specific. The GDPR does not explain this term further.
<br><br>
Rec.32, 42; Art.4(11), 7(1)
Consent must be informed. In order for consent to be informed:
the nature of the processing should be explained in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language which does not contain unfair terms; and the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes for which the personal data will be processed.
<br><br>
Rec.32
Consent must take the form of an affirmative action or statement. Consent can be provided by any appropriate method enabling a freely given, specific and informed indication of the data subjects wishes. For example, depending on the circumstances, valid consent could be provided verbally, in writing, by ticking a box on a web page, by choosing technical settings in an app, or by any other statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subjects acceptance of the proposed processing of their personal data.
<br><br>
Rec.32
Silence, pre-ticked boxes, inactivity, failure to opt-out, or passive acquiescence do not constitute valid consent.
<br><br>
Art.7(2)
If consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent must be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. If the data subject is asked to consent to something that is inconsistent with the requirements of the GDPR, that consent will not be binding.
<br><br>
Rec.42; Art.7(1)
Where any processing activity is performed on the basis of consent, the controller must be able to demonstrate that it has obtained valid consent from the affected data subjects.
<br><br>
Rec.42, 65; Art.7(3)
Data subjects have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject must be informed of the right to withdraw consent. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it.
<br><br>
Rec.111; Art.49(1)(a), (3)
In the absence of other safeguards, transfers may take place if the data subject has explicitly consented to the transfer, having previously been informed of its possible risks. This does not apply to public authorities in the exercise of their powers.
<br><br>
Rec.171
Where an organisation has already collected consent from data subjects (prior to the GDPR Effective Date) it is not necessary to collect that consent a second time in consequence of the GDPR, provided that the initial consent was compliant with the requirements of the GDPR.

Controllers and processors that are outside the EEA, and that are not subject to the GDPR, may adhere to Codes of Conduct in order to create a framework for providing adequate protection to personal data in third countries. The GDPR specifically allows adherence of non-EEA controllers and processors to an approved Code of Conduct to provide the basis for Cross-Border Data Transfers (see Chapter 13).

Art.40(4), 41
An independent body may be appointed by the relevant DPA to monitor and enforce a Code of Conduct if it is:

independent and has demonstrated its expertise; has established procedures for reviewing and assessing compliance with a Code of Conduct; has established procedures for dealing with complaints or infringements of the Code of Conduct; and can demonstrate that it has no conflicts of interest in this role.Such a body may be appointed to monitor and enforce compliance with a Code of Conduct. DPAs still retain their own separate enforcement powers.

Rec.77; Art.24(3), 28(5), 35(8), 46(2)(e), Art.83(2)(j)
Adherence to an approved Code of Conduct:
<br><br>
may provide guidance on specific compliance issues; may provide evidence of compliance with the GDPR; is a positive factor in an Impact Assessment; may provide the basis for Cross-Border Data Transfers (see Chapter 13); and may affect any fines imposed upon the adherent controller or processor.

Art.40(5), 57(1)(p), 58(3)(d)
Draft Codes of Conduct must be submitted to the competent DPA, which must then:
<br><br>
approve the Code of Conduct if it provides sufficient protections in accordance with the GDPR, or amend it if it does not; register and publish approved Codes of Conduct; and publish the criteria for gaining such approval. If a Code of Conduct affects processing in several Member States, DPAs must review the Code of Conduct in accordance with the Consistency Mechanism (see Chapter 15) and refer it to the EDPB.

Art.40(8), 64(1)(b)
The EDPB is required to issue an opinion on any draft Code of Conduct before it is approved. The EDPB must also register and publish approved Codes of Conduct.

Rec.108, 110; Art.4(20) 46(2)(b), 47
The GDPR directly addresses the concept of BCRs. The competent DPA will approve BCRs as an appropriate mechanism for Cross-Border Data Transfers within a corporate group (including to members of that group that are established in third countries). If the BCRs meet the requirements set out in the GDPR, they will be approved, and no further DPA approval will be required for transfers of personal data made under the BCRs.
<br><br>

Rec.108, 110; Art.47(1)-(3)
BCRs must include a mechanism to make the BCRs legally binding on group companies. Among other things, the BCRs must: specify the purposes of the transfer and affected categories of data; reflect the requirements of the GDPR; confirm that the EU-based data exporters accept liability on behalf of the entire group; explain complaint procedures; and provide mechanisms for ensuring compliance (e.g., audits).

Rec.108-109; Art.46(2)(d), 64(1)(d), 57(1)(j), (r), 93(2)
A Cross-Border Data Transfer may take place on the basis of DPA Clauses, which offer a national alternative to the Commission-approved Model Clauses. Transfers made on the basis of DPA Clauses do not require further DPA approval. DPA Clauses may be included in a wider contract (e.g., from one processor to another), provided the original wording of the authorised DPA Clauses is not contradicted (directly or indirectly).

Rec.115; Art.48
A judgment from a third country, requiring a Cross-Border Data Transfer, only provides a lawful basis for such a transfer if the transfer is based on an appropriate international agreement, such as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. However, this is without prejudice to other grounds for a transfer.
