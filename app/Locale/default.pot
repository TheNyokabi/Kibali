The public authorities must ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.\n<br><br>\n\nRec.108, 110; Art.4(20) 46(2)(b), 47\nThe GDPR directly addresses the concept of BCRs. The competent DPA will approve BCRs as an appropriate mechanism for Cross-Border Data Transfers within a corporate group (including to members of that group that are established in third countries). If the BCRs meet the requirements set out in the GDPR, they will be approved, and no further DPA approval will be required for transfers of personal data made under the BCRs.\n<br><br>\n\nRec.108, 110; Art.47(1)-(3)\nBCRs must include a mechanism to make the BCRs legally binding on group companies. Among other things, the BCRs must: specify the purposes of the transfer and affected categories of data; reflect the requirements of the GDPR; confirm that the EU-based data exporters accept liability on behalf of the entire group; explain complaint procedures; and provide mechanisms for ensuring compliance (e.g., audits).\n<br><br>\n\nRec.108, 110; Art.47(1), 57(1)(s)\nThe competent DPA must approve BCRs that fulfil the criteria set out in the GDPR.
