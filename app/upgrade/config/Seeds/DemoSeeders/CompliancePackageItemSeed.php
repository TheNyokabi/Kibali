As an operational network becomes more complex (for example, systems communicating to many destinations, Internet access), so will the intrusion detection capability needed to perform adequate detection. Therefore, simplifying network behaviour is a helpful enabler for more straightforward and effective intrusion detection solutions. Intrusion detection systems often combine signature- and anomaly-based detection methods. Some systems have the ability to respond to any detected intrusion (for example, terminating the connection).',
